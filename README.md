# Weather Snapshot Project

This project combined every steps required in Data Analytics and Visualisation. It served to improve and utilized skills in Python libraries and creating a dynamic website to better host and display such findings.

It is divided into several steps and organized into two main folders: [Data-Extaction](https://github.com/Hong-webport/Weather-SnapShot/tree/main/Data-Extraction%20(Python)/API-Challenge) and [Web](https://github.com/Hong-webport/Weather-SnapShot/tree/main/Web%20(HTML%20%26%20JS)). The results are displayed in the following links.

## Data-Extraction

Using Python and its libraires, I extracted data from reputable, external data sources, converted it into a spreadsheet and created some visualizations for analysis.

#### Source of the Data
The main source of the data is **Openweather API**. 

#### Python Libraires

*Requests* is the library for extracting the data from the API. *Pandas* for transforming and working with the data. *Matplotlib* is the main visualization tool due to its simplicity and speed. Others are imported to assist in creating the list of cities and examine the data with linear regression.

#### The Data Mined and Stored

## Web Display

Using a combinations of CSS and Javascript, I displayed the visualizations and findings resulted from them, in multiple pages. This is the first time ever that I used such tools. My desired goal are to create a slight feeling of dynamism, easy navigation and lack of confusion. 

#### Tools and Component

*Bootstrap4* is a very easy to use tools for dynamism  and responsiveness.

Thumbnails on the left are shortcuts for easy naigation. Keywords are for removing the confusion if they come up and stessing their importance.

Due to my inexperiences, I made many mistakes and learned greatly from them. This project had taught me a ton on Bootstraps and CSS, that I would not have learned had I simply followed a template. This made me very glad.

#### Charts to Display

The goals are to display these and the trends which are observed from them.

While these are admittedly small, I want to work as best as I can with it, so that I can used the challenge for other projects.

#### Navigation

This landing page is the introduction and set the tone for all others wwith the exception of its long introduction. I had to be careful in avoiding making them too clustered.

Either by clicking on the dropdown button on the navigation bar in "Visualization Graphs" or the thumbnails on the left.
#### Mobile

This is a page with analysis looked in a Mobile Screen.
