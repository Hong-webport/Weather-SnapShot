# Weather Sanapsot Project

This project combined every steps required in Data Analytics and Visualisation. It served to improve and utilized skills in Python libraries and creating a dynamic website to better host and display such findings.

It is divided into several steps and organized into two main folders: [Data-Extaction](https://github.com/Hong-webport/Weather-SnapShot/tree/main/Data-Extraction%20(Python)/API-Challenge) and [Web](https://github.com/Hong-webport/Weather-SnapShot/tree/main/Web%20(HTML%20%26%20JS).

Using Python and its libraires, I extracted data from reputable, external data sources, converted it into a spreadsheet and created some visualizations for analysis.

Using a combinations of CSS and Javascript, I displayed the visualizations and findings resulted from them, in multiple pages.
